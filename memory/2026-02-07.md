# 2026-02-07 - System Integration & Security Hardening

## Session Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-07  
**Time:** 19:50-20:00 EST  
**Focus:** Integrating comprehensive operational framework + security protocols

## Context

JC provided massive framework document covering:
- 7 critical security warnings
- Complete file structure (Identity → Operations → Memory → Projects)
- Proactive patterns + growth loops
- HEARTBEAT with checkpointing
- Memory architecture with recovery protocol
- Security vulnerabilities table

## Decisions Made

✓ Create SECURITY.md - Consolidate all security warnings + audit checklist  
✓ Set up memory/ folder structure (daily files + archive)  
✓ Create notes/areas/ for proactive tracking  
✓ Integrate security rules into operational protocol

## Action Items

☐ Rebuild AGENTS.md with proactive patterns + operating rules  
☐ Create WORKFLOWS.md (reusable processes)  
☐ Create INDEX.md (master catalog)  
☐ Update MEMORY.md with security rules + capabilities  
☐ Create KNOWLEDGE.md template (JC to fill in business details)  
☐ Build HEARTBEAT.md with checkpoint protocol  
☐ Create HEARTBEAT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md

## Files Created

- SECURITY.md - Security protocol & warnings
- memory/2026-02-07.md - This checkpoint
- Directory structure: memory/archive, notes/areas, projects, backups

## Current Status

Phase 1 complete (security + memory structure).  
Moving to Phase 2 (operational files: AGENTS, WORKFLOWS, INDEX).

## Work Completed

**Phase 1: Security & Memory Structure**
- ✓ Created SECURITY.md (warnings + audit checklist)
- ✓ Created memory/archive, notes/areas, projects, backups directories
- ✓ Created memory/2026-02-07.md (this checkpoint)

**Phase 2: Core Operational Files**
- ✓ Rebuilt AGENTS.md (operating rules + proactive patterns + growth loops)
- ✓ Created INDEX.md (master catalog)
- ✓ Created WORKFLOWS.md (reusable processes + growth loops)

**Phase 3: Memory & Tracking**
- ✓ Updated MEMORY.md (security rules + capabilities + protocols)
- ✓ Created notes/areas/proactive-ideas.md
- ✓ Created notes/areas/recurring-patterns.md
- ✓ Created notes/areas/capability-wishlist.md
- ✓ Created notes/areas/outcome-journal.md

**Phase 4: Templates**
- ✓ Created KNOWLEDGE.md template (JC to fill in business details)

## Next Steps

**For JC:**
1. Fill in KNOWLEDGE.md (business portfolio, key stories, expertise)
2. Review SECURITY.md (monthly audit checklist)
3. Decide: Do we need HEARTBEAT.md active now? (currently empty = no heartbeat polls)

**For KC:**
1. Create HEARTBEAT.md when/if JC wants periodic checks
2. Create HEARTBEAT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md (diagnostic protocol)
3. Begin using proactive tracking files (notes/areas/)
4. Daily: Update memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md with session checkpoints
