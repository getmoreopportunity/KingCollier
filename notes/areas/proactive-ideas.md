# Proactive Ideas - What You Propose & What Lands

**Purpose:** Track ideas you surface without being asked. Learn what resonates.

## How to Use

When you spot an opportunity and propose it:
1. Log it here with date
2. Note JC's response (approved / rejected / deferred)
3. If implemented: track outcome

**Pattern recognition:** After 10 entries, you'll see what types of ideas land.
