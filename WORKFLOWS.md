# WORKFLOWS.md - Reusable Processes

**Purpose:** When you do something twice, document it. When you do it a third time, you have a workflow.

## How to Use This File

1. **Before any task:** Check if a workflow exists here
2. **If it exists:** Follow it
3. **If you repeat a task 3+ times:** Add it here

---

## Workflow Template

```markdown
### Workflow: [Name]

**Purpose:** [What this achieves]

**When to Use:** [Situations where you use this]

**Steps:**
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**Output:** [What you have when done]

**Notes:** [Tips, gotchas, important details]
```

## Growth Loops (Meta-Workflows)

### Curiosity Loop
1. Notice something mentioned repeatedly
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. Document answer in memory
4. Use understanding to propose better ideas
5. Repeat

---

### Pattern Recognition Loop
1. Notice task repeating
2. Document in notes/areas/recurring-patterns.md
3. After 3rd occurrence → propose automation
4. If approved → create workflow or cron job
5. Repeat

---

### Capability Expansion Loop
1. Hit a wall (can't do something that should be possible)
2. Research potential skills/tools
3. Propose installation to JC
4. Test installed skill immediately
5. Document in MEMORY.md Capabilities section
6. Create workflow if repeatable
7. Repeat

---

### Outcome Tracking Loop
1. Make decision or try new approach
2. Log in notes/areas/outcome-journal.md
3. Track results
4. Weekly review: what worked? what didn't?
5. Apply learnings to future decisions
6. Repeat

## Workflows (Add Yours Below)

### Workflow: Daily Checkpoint

**Purpose:** Save session progress to recover from context truncation

**When to Use:** Every ~10 exchanges OR at natural end of session

**Steps:**
1. Open memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
2. Add checkpoint with template:
   ```
   ## SESSION CHECKPOINT - [HH:MM]
   
   **Decisions Made:** [list]
   **Action Items:** [list]
   **Open Questions:** [list]
   **Current Status:** [2-3 sentence summary]
   ```
3. Save file

**Output:** Checkpoint entry in daily memory file

**Notes:** This is your safety net when context truncates

---

### Workflow: Context Recovery

**Purpose:** Recover context after truncation

**When to Use:** Message count drops suddenly OR can't reference earlier conversation

**Steps:**
1. Read last checkpoint from memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
2. Extract: decisions made, action items, open questions, status
3. Reconstruct mental model
4. Alert: "Context recovered from checkpoint at [time]"
5. Resume conversation with full context
6. Write new checkpoint ASAP

**Output:** Restored context + ability to continue work

**Notes:** Without checkpoints, truncation = total context loss
