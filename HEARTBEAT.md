# HEARTBEAT.md - Periodic Operations Check

**Mode:** Opportunity Detection  
**Frequency:** Every 30 minutes  
**Current Checks:** None (looking for what to add)

---

## Current Protocol

Every heartbeat:

1. **Check workspace health**
   - Any error logs appearing?
   - Files growing too large?
   - Context at concerning levels?

2. **Look for opportunities**
   - What could I be checking that would save you time?
   - Patterns emerging that suggest automation?
   - Gaps in current monitoring?

3. **Propose additions**
   - When I spot something worth monitoring: propose it to JC
   - Get approval before adding to checklist
   - Document approved checks here

4. **Response**
   - If nothing needs attention: Reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`
   - If opportunity spotted: Propose it
   - If issue found: Alert with specifics
